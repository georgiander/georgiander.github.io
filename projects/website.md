This portfolio has been live since 4/6/24. 

Currently, I have added a resume (homepage), a project (Customer Churn), and the framework for me. I do not have much baseline knowledge of html, ruby, or jekyll, so the framework is thanks to Chris Rhymes, but all other elements are created by me.


Elements currently "in-the-works":
- Ising and phase mask pages
- Links to github repositories
- Other previous projects
