# Projects


This is where you can find all of my personal and education projects.

Currently, only Customer Churn is configured but more will be available soon.



I began working with python in 2021 mainly using it to perform complex mathematics for a variety of college projects. I started off modeling projectile motion, reaffirming physics constants and modeling small electromagnetic fields, which eventually evolved to modeling the coriolis effect, using fourier transforms to project images into the fourier plane of lasers, and modeling flipping electicmagnetic fields.

As a physics major, my basis of coding was limited to the experiences above. I have always found my greatest joy in running a successful program that I have poured over so I began learning outside of college as well, where I found a fondness of machine learning and data analytics. I am working to merge my two fascinations and explore fourier analysis within the context of machine learning. As I learn more, I will update here.

Please feel free to browse some of my previous programs from back in college up until now. Each page will have a blurb about the project and its findings and will (eventually) be linked with a GitHub repository so you can view the code as well.
