## Education


### Franklin and Marshall College   				           Lancaster, PA 2023 
Completed BS in three years.
Major in Physics, minor in Theoretical Mathematics.
Coursework in Physics (Mechanics, Electricity, Magnetism, Optics, Simulation coding) and Higher Mathematics (Linear and Abstract Algebra, and Real and Complex Analysis).

### Portland Community College					         Beaverton, OR 2020
AA degree with a focus on Physics. 
Completed in tandem with high school graduation.


## Projects


### Categorical and Continuous Data Analysis
- Performed analysis and cleaning on  continuous (housing) data and categorical data (mushroom genuses).
-Encoded data both nominally and ordinally; removed irrelevant features, outliers, and missing data; normalized skewed data; and deduced and merged connected features.
-Posited key insights, performed significance tests, and posed hypotheses that lead to a single feature which predicts edibility of the mushroom with 89% accuracy.

- Waveform Models and Phase Masks
- Created and captured laser diffraction patterns and perform 100 iterative transforms to produce any small image in the laser’s fourier plane.
- Developed a library to perform Fourier transforms, create, manipulate, and send Gaussian curves in both 2D and 3D to the optical system (SLM), and calibrate the average brightness of an image.
- Formulated a Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to create phase masks of the incoming laser shape in order to output 8-bit images (or animations) with the physical laser.

### Ising Model Simulation
- Developed a model to imitate a randomized magnetic field organizing over time according to the Lenz-Ising model.  The model evalutes each data point’s current “spin” (+1, -1) and decides whether or not to flip it over thousands of iterations leading to a stabilized field model.


## Research and Work Experience

### Franklin and Marshall College
Research Assistant     				                 	       September 2022–June 2023
- Precisely manufactured a Michelson interferometer to establish  3 orders of Laguerre-Gauss beams using an SLM.
- Installed a liquid coolant system within an SLM leading to a 8 hour increase in usability.
- Automated data collection and improved efficiency of the post-experiment analysis.

## Franklin and Marshall College
Summer Research Assistant     			           	   		      June–July 2022
- Installed and tested a new SLM calibrated for 532 nm.
- Synthesized a unique python program to improve experiment conduction time by 30%.
- Implemented a Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to create phase masks that required  around 40% less iterations than typical GS algorithms.
- Engineered a series of phase masks to produce a 143 frame animation within the first-order diffraction beam.
- Presented the findings to a collegiate interdisciplinary audience.
